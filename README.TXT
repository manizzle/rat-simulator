Tested and working on windows/linux with python 2.6.5 32-bit and wxPython 2.8 unicode version.

To run, make sure wxPython is installed and run "python main.py"
To build a stand alone directory/executable, install py2exe and run "python setup.py py2exe".  The directory "RatSimulator/" will contain the stand-alone version.
